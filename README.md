# that-login-form-though
I designed a login form using HTML5 and CSS3. The HTML5 attributes I used were Placeholder, Required, Autofocus, and type="password". As for the CSS part I used a Paper Stack effect (box shadow), the Stitch Effect, and the Subtle gradient lines. The end result was a login form that looks great on all browsers.
